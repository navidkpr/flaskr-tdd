# Pros and Cons of TDD


## Pros
1. It's safer to code and make changes. You will know if one your changes broke another logic in your code.
2. You can automate and include the test cases in the DevOps process. Making sure that the code going into production has minimal bugs
3. New developers will have to be less worried when onboarding and writing new code. Although they do not know the code base it will still be hard to break the code.

## Cons
1. Takes time to write down the tests. In a startup environment this could slow down the team too much.
